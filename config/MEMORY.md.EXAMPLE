# Nella — Long-Term Memory

<!--
This file is a human-editable memory store. Nella reads it as part of her
system prompt context. Add facts, preferences, and notes here that Nella
should always have access to.

Mem0 handles semantic/conversational memory automatically. Use this file
for things you want to explicitly control.

This file is injected into the system prompt to guide tool selection.
Use it for preferences, strategies, and disambiguation — not for
describing what tools do (that lives in the tool source code).

Copy this file to SOUL.md and customize. SOUL.md is gitignored.
