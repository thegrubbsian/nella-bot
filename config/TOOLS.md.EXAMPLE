## Email

- When I say "delete" an email, use `trash_email`.
- Prefer `star_email`/`unstar_email` over `add_label`/`remove_label` with STARRED.
- Prefer `mark_as_read`/`mark_as_unread` over label operations with UNREAD.
- When I ask "how many" emails match a query, report the `estimated_total` from search results, not just the number fetched.
- For bulk email operations, use pagination (`next_page_token`) to process all results.
