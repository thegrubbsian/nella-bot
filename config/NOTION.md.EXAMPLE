# Notion

<!--
This file is loaded into the system prompt when NOTION_API_KEY is set.
Use it to tell Nella about your Notion databases — their IDs, schemas,
and how you want her to use them.

Copy this file to NOTION.md and customize. NOTION.md is gitignored.

To find a database ID: open the database as a full page in Notion,
copy the URL. The ID is the 32-character hex string before the ?v= parameter:
https://www.notion.so/myworkspace/<DATABASE_ID>?v=...
-->

## Databases

### Tasks
- **Database ID:** `<paste your tasks database ID here>`
- **Properties:**
  - Name (title) — task name
  - Status (status) — Not Started, In Progress, Done
  - Priority (select) — High, Medium, Low
  - Due Date (date) — deadline
  - Tags (multi_select) — project labels
- **Usage:** When I say "add a task", create a page here with Status = Not Started. When I ask about my tasks, query this database. Use filters on Status to show open tasks by default.

### Notes
- **Database ID:** `<paste your notes database ID here>`
- **Properties:**
  - Name (title) — note title
  - Tags (multi_select) — topic labels
  - Created (created_time) — auto-set by Notion
- **Usage:** When I say "make a note" or "write this down", create a page here. Put the main content in the page body, not in properties.

<!--
Add more databases as needed. The format above helps Nella understand
what each database is for and how to use it correctly.

Tips:
- Include all property names and types so Nella formats values correctly
- Add usage hints so Nella knows which database to use for which request
- Notion search only searches page titles, not body content — mention this
  if relevant (e.g., "to find notes by content, use notion_query_database
  with a filter instead of notion_search")
- Nella can create child pages under any page (not just databases) — useful
  for building out hierarchical structures like project wikis
- Content supports markdown: headings, bullets, numbered lists, to-do items,
  blockquotes, code blocks, and dividers are all converted to native Notion blocks
- Nella can create new databases inside pages with a simplified schema format
